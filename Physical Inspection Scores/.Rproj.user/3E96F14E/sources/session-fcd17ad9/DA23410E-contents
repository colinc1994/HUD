## Distribution of Cancer Diagnoses

Among all the diagnoses, the majority were breast cancer. Since there were multiple diagnoses for some patients, we can also examine the first recorded diagnosis. Almost three-quarters of the patients' first diagnoses were breast cancer.

# Timing of Treatments from First Diagnosis

The median time from first diagnosis to first treatment was five days with a mean of almost twelve, showing a skew in the data. Two patients were excluded due to having negative times recorded.

# Analysis of Treatment Methods

Using Fisher's Exact Test, a significant difference was seen in the uptake between the first diagnoses and their first treatment. A majority of the patients who were first diagnosed with breast cancer had treatments A and B. It seems likely that treatments A and B were more associated with breast cancer patients. There is some evidence to show that treatment C and D are associated with the regiment of colon cancer patients.

# Analysis of Timing Between First Treatment and First Diagnosis for Drugs A and B

Using standard survival analysis methods, we can use a Kaplan-Meier curve to examine the incidence rate of treatments A and B, limiting it to 100 days. To test for significant differences in the median time, the Log-Rank test can be used to show a high p-value, suggesting that there are no differences in the time between first diagnosis and first treatment concerning A and B.
