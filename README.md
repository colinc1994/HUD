# Open Data Analysis of the Department of Housing and Urban Devolopment (HUD)

# Intro
Using the open data freely published from the [HUD](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdrdatas_landing.html), estimates such as subsidized housing costs, inventory counts, and other relevant metrics can be easily read into R and merged with other relevant data based the Core Based Statistical Area.

# Core Based Statistical Area
Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) are crucial for a wide range of analyses due to their role in defining metropolitan and micropolitan regions based on population density and economic integration. Here are several reasons why CBSAs are relevant:

1. **Standardization in Data Collection**: CBSAs provide a standardized method for defining urban and rural areas, which is essential for consistent data collection and comparison. This standardization allows for more accurate demographic, economic, and social analyses. By delineating areas into metropolitan and micropolitan categories, CBSAs facilitate the aggregation and comparison of data across different regions, ensuring that studies and policies are based on comparable metrics.

2. **Economic and Policy Planning**: CBSAs are instrumental in economic development and policy planning. They help identify areas with significant economic integration, which can influence decisions on where to allocate resources, develop infrastructure, and implement economic policies. For instance, understanding the commuting patterns and economic ties within a CBSA can guide investments in transportation and public services.

3. **Public Health and Social Services**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, CBSAs played a critical role in understanding the spread of the virus and the allocation of healthcare resources. Different CBSA categories (metropolitan, micropolitan, or neither) have different healthcare infrastructures and social services, which impacted how communities managed and responded to the pandemic. This highlights the importance of using CBSAs in public health research and emergency response planning.

4. **Housing and Urban Development**: CBSAs are used to analyze housing markets and urban development patterns. By distinguishing between central and outlying counties within a metropolitan area, researchers can study the variations in housing demand, prices, and urban sprawl. This information is valuable for city planners and policymakers aiming to address housing shortages and plan sustainable urban growth.

5. **Census and Statistical Analysis**: The U.S. Census Bureau and other statistical agencies rely on CBSAs for conducting surveys and censuses. These areas provide a framework for understanding population distribution and dynamics, which is crucial for demographic studies, electoral analysis, and the allocation of federal funds. The consistent use of CBSAs ensures that statistical data is comparable over time and across different regions.
